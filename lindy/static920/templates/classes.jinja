              <p>Classes are normally a four-week series, beginning on the first Thursday of the month. Classes are progressive, meaning that every week we build upon the moves taught in the previous class. If you miss the first class of the series, you will be unenrolled and given an account credit to be used toward a future series. New drop-ins are allowed the first week only. All classes include admission to the dance.</p>
              <p>Class series are $55 each if purchased online. If you sign up at the door, our class series are $65 each. *Prices are adjusted for 3-week and 5-week months. A few times a year, we have a live band and will add $10 to the price of all series classes.</p>
              <p>In order to receive credit for the series, you must attend at least three of the four weeks of class.
              <h3>Level Checks</h3>
              <p>If you would like to take a higher-level class, but don't have the prerequisites, youâ€™ll need to do a Level Check. We do these the first Thursday of every month at <strong>7PM sharp</strong>. <em>We have a very short window!</em> You'll social dance with one of our instructors to determine which level is the best fit. Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@920special.com">info@920special.com</a> with any questions.</p>

              <p>Every Thursday from 9:30-10:00 PM, we offer a 30-minute beginner class included in the price of dance admission ($7 students/seniors/military, $9 regular). Open to everyone, but geared toward beginners, this class will give you a taste of why Lindy Hop is our favorite partner dance. You'll learn some fun moves you can practice immediately following the class at our social dance party.</p>

              <strong>Time: <em>7:20 PM and 8:30 PM</em></strong><br>
              <strong>Prerequisite: <em>None</em></strong>
              <p>If you are new to swing dancing and Lindy Hop, this monthly series is for you. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners frequently in class.</p>
              <p>Each series starts on the first Thursday of the month and is progressive, meaning that every week we build upon the moves taught in the previous class. New drop-ins are allowed the first week only. If you've missed the first class, you can take our 30-minute Taster class at 9:30PM then join the series the following month.</p>
              <p>If you want to eventually move to Level 2, you'll need to take all three months of Level 1 - A, B, and C. Each month includes different curriculum which overlaps with each other. You can take these Level 1 classes in any order (so it doesn't matter if you start with A or not).</p>
              <p>The dance, which is included in the price of the class, starts at 9:30pm. It's important (and fun!) to practice at the dance so if you take the 7:20pm class just be aware that there's an hour in between class and the dance. Some people prefer this because they like to get dinner between class and the dance. Others prefer to have the dance immediately following their class.</p>
              <p>We recommend the 8:30pm class because it makes it easier to stick around for the dance. But totally up to you!</p>

                <strong>Time: <em>8:30 PM</em></strong><br>
                <strong>Prerequisites: <em>Varies. See below for details</em></strong>
                <p>Every month, this class category will rotate between Special Topics, Solo Jazz, and Level 4 which means each of these will be offered 4 times per year.</p>
                <h4>Special Topics</h4>
                <strong>Prerequisite: <em>Level 3 and above</em></strong>
                <p>This class will include topics outside our standard curriculum, allowing our students to experience and learn beyond the fundamentals. Topics may include Fast Lindy Hop or Balboa for Lindy Hoppers or a partnered choreography class - the sky is the limit!</p> 
                <h4>Solo Jazz</h4>
                <strong>Prerequisite: <em>Varies. See class description in MindBody</em></strong>
                <p>Working on your solo dancing is one of the best ways to bring your partnered dancing to the next level, not to mention how much fun it is! This class will teach you original routines created by our instructors, classic sequences, and break down jazz steps that you will then be able to incorporate into your partnered dancing.</p>
                <h4>Lindy 4</h4>
                <strong>Prerequisite: <em>Audition only</em></strong>
                <p>If you've been dancing Lindy Hop for a few years, have completed all months of Lindy 3 multiple times, travel to dance, and practice frequently because you feel like there are always things to work on, this is the level to strive for. The group will be small to maximize direct feedback from the instructors. An audition is required to take this class. Auditions will occur one Thursday the month prior to the Lindy 4 class.</p>
                <p>Teachers will bring their own special ideas to these classes, so they can be taken over and over again, and classes will be tailored to the needs of the students.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to improve your dancing further (and possibly faster), you can take private lessons.</p>

            <p>Supplementing group classes with a private lesson here and there can help address any issues you might be having, or master the material more quickly so you don't feel the need to repeat a level.
